## Here is how I would usually setup my new Fedora system from scratch. Here is what i would typically install

    Install Kitty.
    Install Homebrew for yazi
    Install libbsd, and perl through dnf
    Install zsh and Setup oh-my-zsh.
    Setup pipx.
    Setup NVM for zsh.
    Lastly, clone nvim config.


### This config differs from the first one as I also include self-configured oxocarbon theme for vscode and kitty terminal, which i love the Zed and Neovim version of it. 
    
## Ricing details for Fedora KDE coming soon.
